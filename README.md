# ORIGINAL README
## AMXWrapper
AMXWrapper is a wrapper for the pawn abstract machine library

```
pawn is a simple, typeless, 32-bit extension language with a C-like
syntax. A pawn "source" program is compiled to a binary file for optimal
execution speed. The pawn compiler outputs P-code (or bytecode) that
subsequently runs on an abstract machine. Execution speed, stability,
simplicity and a small footprint were essential design criteria for both
the language and the abstract machine.
```

This library is merely an OO-wrapper around the amx functions [the amx32 library provides](https://github.com/ikkentim/AMXWrapper/blob/master/src/amx32/amx32.def).



# ðŸš§ This library will be maintained if bugs or anything needs to be done if the original creator doesn't have the time (respectively) to do that.

## Current fixes
 - Floating point support
